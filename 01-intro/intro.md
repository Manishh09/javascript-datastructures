# What are Data Structures?

- If we want to organize , store, and manage data efficiently, we need to use data structures.
  
- A data structure is a specialized format or way of organizing and managing data in a computer.

- We can say data structures are a collection of data elements that are stored together.

# Why Data Structures are Important?
- Helps in organizing data efficiently in the form of MEMORY and TIME.
- Efficient data structures help in optimizing the performance of algorithms.
- They help in managing large amounts of data, such as large databases.

Note: Selecting the right data structure can significantly impact the efficiency of a program or application.

How? - Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses.
For example:
  - Arrays provide fast access to elements using indices but have a fixed size.
  - Linked lists offer dynamic sizing but have slower access times.

# Types of Data Structures

## Built-in Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Objects
- Sets
- Maps

## Custom Data Structures:
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Circular Queues
